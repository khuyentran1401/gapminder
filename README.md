# Visualising proportions
This is a short, simple article on visualising proportions

I use the gapminder data included in Plotly, and 18-19 Toronto Raptors datasets

## Data
- srcdata/raptors_18_19_shots_summary_2mins.csv is the shot shares in 2 minute intervals for the 18-19 Raptors season
- srcdata/raptors_18_19_shots_summary.csv is the shot shares in 1 minute intervals for the 18-19 Raptors season
